Monitoring lets you:

    - Detect problems before they occur and bring the API down
        e.g. heavy load on CPU is developing, etc

    - If a problem does occur, monitoring alerts you of it

    - Offers analytics about usage, e.g. number of clients, their location, etc


Things to monitor:

    - Requests per second
    - Number of failures
    - Latency
    - Average CPU utilization
    - RAM utilization (if too high can signal memory leak)
    - Number of users
        - number of unique clients
    - Number of sessions
        - number of total requests
    - Geographical distribution of users
