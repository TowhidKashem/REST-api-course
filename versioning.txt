Set a well defined version support policy
    have end of life statement

The api version can be specified in one of three ways:

    - in the URL (most common/easiest)
    - as a query parameter (don't use, bad)
    - in the header (accept header) <-- most adheres to REST principles

Although the header route is the best practise, the URL route is more common and the self explanatory nature of it makes it a good option as well. Practically speaking either of these two are fine
