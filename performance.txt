Use async operations when performing heavy tasks (like database or file access)
    - frees up threads
    - this way you can keep doing other things in the meantime instead of just waiting for the previous 
      code to finish before starting the rest

Caching
    - store frequently used data in memory
    - set expiration time and invalidation logic (to avoid stale data)

Rate limiting
    - put a rate limiter in front of the API which blocks too many requests
    - rate limiter responds with 429 HTTP_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS response to client

Quotas
    - limit the number of requests a specific client can make
    - can be a combination of several conditions like:
        - 50k requests a day
        - 10 requests max per second per IP address,
        - etc
